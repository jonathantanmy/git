imap.folder::
	The folder to drop the mails into, which is typically the Drafts
	folder. For example: "INBOX.Drafts", "INBOX/Drafts" or
	"[Gmail]/Drafts". Required.

imap.tunnel::
	Command used to setup a tunnel to the IMAP server through which
	commands will be piped instead of using a direct network connection
	to the server. Required when imap.host is not set.

imap.host::
	A URL identifying the server. Use an `imap://` prefix for non-secure
	connections and an `imaps://` prefix for secure connections.
	Ignored when imap.tunnel is set, but required otherwise.

imap.user::
	The username to use when logging in to the server.

imap.pass::
	The password to use when logging in to the server.

imap.port::
	An integer port number to connect to on the server.
	Defaults to 143 for imap:// hosts and 993 for imaps:// hosts.
	Ignored when imap.tunnel is set.

imap.sslverify::
	A boolean to enable/disable verification of the server certificate
	used by the SSL/TLS connection.

imap.preformattedHTML::
	A boolean to enable/disable the use of html encoding when sending
	a patch.  An html encoded patch will be bracketed with <pre>
	and have a content type of text/html.  Ironically, enabling this
	option causes Thunderbird to send the patch as a plain/text,
	format=fixed email.  Default is `false`.

imap.authMethod::
	Specify authenticate method for authentication with IMAP server.
	If you're using imap.tunnel, the only supported method is 'CRAM-MD5'.
	If this is not set
	then 'git imap-send' uses the basic IMAP plaintext LOGIN command.
