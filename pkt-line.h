 * A length of 'zero' means end of stream (and a length of 1-3
 * would be an error).
 *
 * This is all pretty stupid, but we use this packetized line
 * format to make a streaming format possible without ever
 * over-running the read buffers. That way we'll never read
 * into what might be the pack data (which should go to another
 * process entirely).
 *
 * The writing side could use stdio, but since the reading
 * side can't, we stay with pure read/write interfaces.
